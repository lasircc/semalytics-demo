# Semalytics core demo

Welcome to the demo of the data framework of Semalytics, a semantic-based tool for analyzing hierarchical data in translational cancer research, which exploits [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) as extended knowledge base for data annotation. This demo is bundled with the paper:

>_Semalytics: a semantic analytics platform for the exploration of distributed and heterogenous cancer data (in translational research) (currently under review)_

## Quick overview

If you are just interested in glancing at static examples of `SPARQL` queries and check out how we got paper results, you might want to take a look at [this computational narrative](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lasircc/semalytics-demo/blob/master/notebook/demo/semalytics-demo.ipynb).

Otherwise, if you want to take a deep dive into the platform, check out how following sections to run it on your system.

## Running Semalytics

We provide a Docker-based installation to run the Semalytics data core locally.

### Requirements

Before you start, you need to install:

* [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (tested: v.18.09.0-ce)
* [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (tested: v.1.23.2)

Note: this demo is powered by [Ontotext GraphDBâ„¢](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/) (Free version): a semantic graph database (RDF triplestore) anb by [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).

### Getting a copy of this repository and testing data

To run Semalytics, a copy of this repo is necessary. Move to your home directory (or to a folder where your user can read-write with no permissions problem) and `clone` the repo into the sub-folder `semalytics-demo`:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lasircc/semalytics-demo.git semalytics-demo
```

Now it's time to get data and put them in the right place. Download the data file `annotationDB_paper.tar.gz` from this [URL](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k_Vhn_JIPhXKBoXMAFK9xwJVr6x5g8Gw?usp=sharing), uncompress it into the folder `<path-to-the-repo>/semalytics-demo/graphdb/graphdb-home/data/repositories/`

```bash
$ tar zxvf annotationDB_paper.tar.gz -C <path-to-the-repo>/semalytics-demo/graphdb/graphdb-home/data/repositories/
```

It creates this directories tree:
```
semalytics-demo/
|
 - graphdb/
    |
    - graphdb-home/
        |
        - data/
            |
            - repositories/
                |
                - annotationDB/
```

>**Legal note**: we allow anyone to use this data for demonstration purpose only. We do not allow any different usage. For further information, please contact paper authors.

>**Data disclaimer**: this is a prototype of a research platform. These data should not be used for emergencies or medical or professional advice or any clinical decision making.

Now, you just need to run the app ðŸš€

### Running Semalytics

Now move to the folder `<path-to-the-repo>/semalytics-demo/`. To start the containers (i.e., `notebook`and `graphDB`), run:

`$ docker-compose up`

Such process may take several minutes. It's time for a cup of coffee â˜•

Once ended, you will see the aggregated output of each container. It must resemble the following one:


```

```

Please, grab and copy the login token from the log at the end of the `docker-compose` process. It is shown at the end of the URL as the param `token`. In this example, it is:

```
7cf64f7836e030722d0254a1e828909a47378e67ab3069f4
```

You will use that for accessing Jupyter Notebook.

Great job, you are all set!


### Using GraphDB to explore data

You can access GraphDB workbench at [`http://semalytics:7200/`](http://semalytics:7200/)

Select "**annotationDB**" from the dropdown menu at the top right corner of the Web interface. Now you can use GraphDB to explore translational data.

Further information about the usage of GraphDB can be found in the [official documentation](http://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/free/).


### Semalytics walkthrough with Jupyter Notebook + Python

You can explore, run, and modify a Python-based Jupyter Notebook. It explores Semalitycs data with several queries and additional explanations. To use it, open up the Jupyter interface passing your token through the following URL:

```
http://localhost:8888/?token=<your-token-here>
```

Open the folder `demo` and click on `semalytics-demo.ipynb` to start the notebook.

Now, you can explore, edit and run the walkthrough. To run all the cells, click on the fast forward icon on the command bar.

That's all!
